This repository contains files written by Steven Court and Bartlomiej Waclaw, University of Edinburgh. 

- 2 separate programs to generate biochemically feasible reactions from EC numbers:  networkgeneration_steve and networkgeneration_bartek
- Some evolutionary simulations

"_bartek" program automatically calculates Delta-G values via a group contribution method, trained on experimental Delta-G values from Alberty's database [1]
"_steven" currently does not implement any thermodynamics.  
See separate readme files in each directory for more details.

This work is based upon the article 

"Lower glycolysis carries a higher flux than any biochemically possible alternative", S. J. Court, B. Waclaw, R. J. Allen, Nature Communications 6 (2015),8427, doi:10.1038/ncomms9427.
